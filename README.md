*Centre Of Excellence*  


Phase - 1 - Define principles, standards and catalogues


* to serve the needs of the business, we build products, services and platforms

* we engage markets and deploy good people to build the products, service and platforms  
 
* what we build will normally involve UI/presentation, logic and infrastructure technologies 
 
* we maintain and secure what we build and ensure our products, services and platforms are compliant
 
* to manage the above (blocks) we apply 
 
	* principles (so that we all pulling in the same direction)
 
	* standards (How things should be done ) and 
 
	* we maintain catalogues of what we have 
 
* principles, standards and catalogues are available to all (via github) 
 
* Github repos covering principles, standards and catalogues will have the same look and feel and it will be simple and straightforward to find information and make contributions( for example if you are  at the start of your project, you maybe interested in principles and catalogues but as you start engaging people and markets you may want to benefit from applying the relevant how to standards to get there quicker)
